                        <p>Our Proposals are custom-designed web pages equipped with specific tools based on the template and use case. These pages serve as representative catalogs, promos or price-lists, from which the dealer can connect the offered products to his workspace just in 1 click and start to use them: combine products from many suppliers, share them with dealers or make quotes for customers.</p>
                        <p>Quotalogic Proposals also can serve as a company website, a public price list or as a quick-set configurable quote for a customer with adoptive product description and sales tools (chat, online payment, invoicing etc).</p>
